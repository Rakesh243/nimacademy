# Control Structures

## if

The `if` control structure is pretty similar to most programming languages and can be nested as well.

```
if 4 < 5:
  echo "4 is less than 5"
else:
  echo "4 isn't less than 5"
```

There is a special keyword `elif` that is used to check for additional conditionals to be met:

```
if 4 > 5:
  echo "4 is greater than 5"
elif 4 < 5:
  echo "4 is less than 5"
else:
  echo "Something else is true"
```

## while

## case

## for
