## About Nim Academy

Nim Academy was created as a simple quick reference and easy to read overview of the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) Programming Language.

It is for those who are just learning to program and skilled programmers trying to grasp the language.  It is very much a work in progress and contributions are welcome.  The focus is on small text explainations and equally small code snippets to explain a concept.  It is partially inspired by the project that has a similar focus for the Elixir language called [Elixir School](https://elixirschool.com).
